| Component            | Weight | Notes                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Written Assignments  | 40%    | 5 Principles + 5 Methods papers (4 % each)                            |
| Tests (2)            | 30%    | 15 % each, 30 multiple-correct questions, proctored via Honorlock     |
| Final Project        | 20%    | Full HCI design cycle; individual or team options                     |
| Participation        | 10%    | Peer reviews, surveys, forum contributions, etc.                      |

### ✍️ Assignments

**Principles (P1–P5)** – Short-answer reflections.  
**Methods (M1–M5)** – Need-finding plans, prototype mock-ups, and evaluation protocols.  
Each paper uses the required *JDF* template and counts for 4 % of the final grade.

---

### 🧪 Tests

Two closed-book, proctored exams (Test 1 after Lesson 3.5, Test 2 after Lesson 4.3).  
Questions are multiple-correct; partial credit is awarded.

---

### 🗂 Project

A single **20%** capstone covers need-finding, brainstorming, prototyping, and an evaluation plan on a domain of your choice. The project can be a portfolio piece.

---

### 📚 Course Content

**Unit 1: Introduction** – HCI overview & course roadmap.  
**Unit 2: Principles** – Feedback cycles, direct manipulation, design heuristics, mental models, task analysis, politics of interfaces.  
**Unit 3: Methods** – Ethics, need-finding, design alternatives, prototyping, evaluation, agile HCI.  
**Unit 4: Applications** – Technology horizons, domain deep-dives (AR/VR, education, health).  
**Unit 5: Conclusion** – Recap, related fields, career next steps.

### 💬 Participation & Interaction

Credit comes from prompt peer-review turnaround, forum activity, and an optional “secret-survey” Easter egg. The deliverables and thier requirements were straighforward.

### 💭 Final Thoughts

CS 6750 walks you through a classic user‑centered design process. If you’re interested in UI/UX, it provides a solid foundation and covers the core fundamentals. Be ready for heavy writing, nearly every assignment outside the exams is an essay. Although my role is not that of a designer, the course’s design principles show up in my daily work. The mantra “You are not your user” alone could save engineers who rush into building from a lot of wasted time and effort.
