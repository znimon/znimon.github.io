### ‚úçÔ∏è¬†Assignments

##### Assignment 1, Part 1: Basic Ray Tracing

Kicks off the course by guiding you through building a basic ray tracer from scratch. You'll implement camera-based ray generation, axis-aligned box intersection testing, occlusion logic, and normal visualization across sample scenes using Java + Processing.

##### Assignment 1, Part 2: Ray Tracing Shading and Optimization

Expands your ray tracer with triangle intersection, Lambertian shading, and shadow rays for realistic lighting. You‚Äôll implement instancing and build a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) to optimize performance on complex scenes.

##### Assignment 1, Part 3: Distribution Ray Tracing

*Advanced ray tracing: reflections, shadow softening, and material variation*

Adds realism to your renderer by implementing multiple rays per pixel for effects like anti-aliasing, depth of field, motion blur, and soft shadows. You'll also support Blinn-Phong specular highlights, reflective surfaces, and area lights using disk sampling. This part pushes your ray tracer into photorealistic territory and ties together all prior work in a fully recursive, physically-inspired rendering pipeline.

##### Assignment 2: Implicit Surfaces

*Ten randomly positioned spheres with blended colors and surfaces*

Challenges you to generate complex 3D models using skeletal primitives, fall-off functions, and the Marching Cubes algorithm. You‚Äôll implement shape blending, deformations (twist, taper), constructive solid geometry, and color blending for randomized scenes.

##### Assignment 3: Mesh Manipulation

*star.ply: 3 iterations of Butterfly subdivision, noise added, and 40 iterations of Laplacian smoothing*

Focuses on representing and refining triangle meshes using subdivision and smoothing algorithms. You‚Äôll implement the corner table data structure, calculate adjacency and per-vertex normals, and apply Loop and Butterfly subdivision schemes to smooth and densify geometry. The assignment wraps up with Laplacian and Taubin smoothing, giving you hands-on experience with geometry processing pipelines common in 3D modeling, simulation, and real-time graphics engines.

### üí¨ Class Participation & Interaction

The Ed forum is active, with assignment threads often providing crucial clarifications. TAs are responsive and helpful on both public and private posts. Office hours are typically held three times per week in one-hour nigh sessions (EST).

### üí≠ Final Thoughts

This course is conceptually dense, with a large volume of material presented quickly, and the assignments are notably challenging. The lectures, while thorough, can be overly verbose and at times repetitive; with some tightening and streamlining, they could be even more effective. The project PDFs and forum threads offer just enough guidance to complete the assignments. Java (with the IntelliJ IDE) and Processing provided an interesting development environment, though I would have preferred C++ or C# given their common use in game engines. That said, the assignments were highly rewarding, and the immediate visual feedback made the course work engaging and satisfying.

#### Further Learning Resources
**Originally suggested by course TAs Christopher Dannemiller and Matthew Peters*

Books   
- Real-Time Rendering: The gold standard for graphics programmers
- Essential Mathematics for Games and Interactive Applications
- 3D Game Engine Design by Dave Eberly: Recommended as a top pick from [his work](geometrictools.com) on interactive 3D applications.

API   
- Start with OpenGL which is simpler to learn and more beginner-friendly than Vulkan, DirectX 12, or Metal.
