**Instructor**: *Tucker Balch & David Joyner*  
**Semester**: *Spring 2023*  
**Overall Rating**: **7.3/10** 👍

---

✅ **Pros**

- Clear rubric and generous project weighting (71 % of the grade) lets you recover from weak exam scores  
- Hands‑on, autograded projects  
- Plentiful TA office hours 

❌ **Cons**

- Lectures use some dated libraries (e.g., Q‑learning code in Python 2 style), requiring refactors  
- Autograder is unforgiving

### 🕒 Time Commitment

Plan on **15 – 25 hours per week**. The early projects are manageable, but workload spikes with Projects 7–8 and exam prep.
