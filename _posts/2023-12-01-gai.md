 ✅ Pros
- The instructor is passionate, approachable, and genuinely invested in student success.
- Engaging and interesting subject matter.
- Challenging assignments that significantly improved my programming skills.
- Applying AI concepts in practical scenarios greatly reinforced learning.
- The video game setting and visual feedback made assignments very rewarding.

 ❌ Cons
- Attending TA office hours often felt necessary to clarify assignment requirements and techniques.
- The course is fair but definitely challenging (not necessarily a con, but worth mentioning).
- Students with no Unity or C++ experience may need to invest some additional time.

### 🕒 Time Commitment

Expect to spend 10 to 20 hours per assignment and 3 hours per week on modules and notes.

### ✍️ Assignments

Assignments are provided via a Git repo containing a Unity project. Each assignment includes automated tests that you can run locally, passing these generally ensures a good grade but doesn't guarantee full credit. You're often expected to identify additional edge cases and expand upon the provided tests.

#### HW 1 – Grid Lattice
- **Theme:** *Static‑grid navigation*
- **Build & Learn:** Superimpose a traversable/blocked Boolean grid over any Unity scene; implement `CreateGrid` and `IsTraversable`; intro to basic computational‑geometry helpers.
- **Reflection:** Solid warm‑up—the, most time goes to collision logic edge cases.

#### HW 2 – Path Network
- **Theme:** *Sparse waypoint graphs*
- **Build & Learn:** Connect supplied path nodes while clearing obstacles and agent radius; produce bidirectional, duplicate‑free edge lists.
- **Reflection:** Essential to use debugging interface provided and consider edge cases to pass automated checks.

#### HW 3 – A\* Path‑finding
- **Theme:** Incremental A\*
- **Build & Learn:** Add cost and heuristics; implement `FindPathIncremental` to spread search over frames; return closest‑to‑goal paths when blocked.
- **Reflection:** I found this assignment informative but also challenging.

#### HW 4 – NavMesh Generation
- **Theme:** *Convex polygons + portals*
- **Build & Learn:** Triangulate free space, merge into convex nav‑polygons, drop portal‑midpoint nodes, and fully connect them.
- **Reflection:** Assignments 1 - 4 all use the same Unity project and somewhat build on one another.

#### HW 5 – Ballistic Projectiles
- **Theme:** *Predictive throws*
- **Build & Learn:** In `PredictThrow` and `ShotSelection`, solve closed‑form or iterative ballistic intercepts (static → moving targets) and decide when to throw.
- **Reflection:** Technique in the Millington book psuedo code helps a ton here.

#### HW 6 – Prison Dodgeball FSM
- **Theme:** *Full game AI*
- **Build & Learn:** Design an FSM that coordinates a team, leverages your ballistic solver, and wins ≥ ⅔ vs. baseline “Glass Joe” and secret bots.
- **Reflection:** Great example of a FSM, need to observe the dodgball game many times to determine how to improve technique. Seting up FSM debugging is essential.

#### HW 7 – Race Track AI
- **Theme:** *Fuzzy‑logic (and optional ML‑Agents)*
- **Build & Learn:** Create fuzzy sets/rules (or a neural net) to steer an arcade truck on procedurally generated tracks without crashing while maintaining target speeds.
- **Reflection:** Tuning memberships is part art, part data logging—straight track is easy, hairpins less so.

#### HW 8 – Procedural Content Generation
- **Theme:** *Perlin‑noise terrain*
- **Build & Learn:** Author a PCG node graph that segments one noise source into three biomes; submit the `PCGTerrainData.asset` plus screenshots.
- **Reflection:** A nice break from the more difficult assignments, no code grading just vibes.

### 📖 Exams
- Overall: The exams were challenging but fair.
- Format & Weight: One proctored midterm and one proctored final, each worth 15 % of your grade (30 % total). Both are administered through HonorLock.
- Scope: The final covers only the second half of the course; neither exam is cumulative.
- Resources: Open‑book—you may consult any Canvas materials or the textbook, but no collaboration is allowed.
- Timing: You have up to 4 hours in a single sitting; well‑prepared students typically finish in about an hour.
- Questions & Grading: All items draw directly from the lectures. Multiple‑answer items may earn partial credit; binary (e.g., true/false) items do not. A curve is applied after each exam.

### 📚 Course Content

There are 6 modules that relate directly to the homework assignments you'll often reference back to slides in the lectures for homework hints and techniques, 1.5x+ playback speed is your friend.

**Module 0 · Onboarding & Unity Setup**  
You’ll install Unity 3D and verify the IDE with test scenes.

**Module 1 · Game‑AI Fundamentals**  
Covers the role of AI in games, basic agent movement, and core computational‑geometry tests (line intersections, distances, quadtrees, Voronoi diagrams). These essentials ground later techniques.

**Module 2 · Navigation & Path Planning**  
Builds intelligent movement from the ground up: grid lattices, classical search algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Greedy, A*), path networks, and navigation meshes—construction, refinement, and performance trade‑offs.

**Module 3 · Steering, Targeting & Group Motion**  
Explores delegated and blended steering behaviors, ballistic projectile targeting (static and moving), coordinated movement, and fairness checks, giving agents smooth, believable locomotion and combat skills.

**Module 4 · Decision‑Making & Learning**  
Introduces decision trees, finite‑state machines, behavior trees, fuzzy logic, and goal‑oriented action planning, then adds data‑driven AI—case‑based reasoning, n‑grams, Naive Bayes, exploration vs. exploitation, and Q‑learning—to create adaptive opponents.

**Module 5 · Procedural Content Generation**  
Surveys RNG techniques, terrain synthesis, object placement, grammars, search‑based and constraint‑propagation methods, plus player‑modelling approaches to generate fresh, personalized game worlds.

**Module 6 · Camera Control & Advanced Search**  
Wraps up with cinematic camera techniques and adversarial search algorithms—Minimax and Monte Carlo Tree Search—for strategy, board‑game, and high‑level planning AI.

### 💬 Class Participation & Interaction

The instructor, Jeff Wilson, is very active and responsive on Ed, and he's available for office hours by request. TA office hours occur multiple times weekly, usually on a consistent schedule. I found attending these OH essential for success. Typically, about 3 out of 5 TAs provided helpful office hours each week, while the others either didn't show up  or weren't as helpful with assignments.

### 🎯 Learning Outcomes

This was one of my top 3 favorite courses in the entire OMSCS program. Applying ML concepts within a video game setting made these techniques much more tangible for me. Additionally, the assignment formats weren't overly constrained, and I genuinely grew as a programmer through this course.
