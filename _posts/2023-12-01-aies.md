✅ **Pros**

- Introduces fairness and bias‑mitigation
- Touches on some U.S. and international regulations around algorithmic fairness, bias, and data privacy
- You could feasibly complete the coursework in far less time than the schedule suggests

❌ **Cons**

- Falls short of its responsibility to keep pace with the evolving AI/ML ethical issues impacting society today
- Examples and datasets are dated (some pre‑2016) uundermining course relevance
- Most assignments seem like rote busy‑work
- The lectures are dumbed down to a point that they read closer to a high‑school survey than a graduate‑level course

### 🕒 Time Commitment

Plan on **1 hour per week** for lectures and assignments.

### 💭 Final Thoughts

CS 6603 tackles an undeniably important subject, yet the execution lags behind the AI landscape. Outdated examples and an almost child‑like delivery style left me wanting more depth and currency. A refresh of materials and tone could easily turn this from a **4.1/10** into a must‑take course.
