This device offers plenty of performance for a media server and draws minimal power, making it perfect for 24/7 operation.

## üí∞ Cost

I canceled two streaming subscriptions, one at $14/month and another at $16/month, for a total savings of $30 per month. The mini PC cost me $140 upfront, and based on an estimated 12W average power draw, it costs roughly $1.50 per month to run. That means I‚Äôll break even in about five months. After that, it‚Äôs all savings.


**Monthly Savings and Cost:**

| Item                          | Monthly Cost | Notes                                     |
|-------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Canceled Streaming Services   | -$30.00      | $14 + $16 per month saved                 |
| Electricity for Mini PC (12W) | $1.50        | Estimated based on 12W continuous usage   |
| **Net Monthly Savings**       | **$28.50**   | After accounting for electricity costs    |

**One-Time Hardware Cost:**

# üìñ Guide

## üêß Install Ubuntu Server

The mini PC comes with Windows 11, but since we're only using it to host Jellyfin, we don‚Äôt want the OS to take up too much storage. Ubuntu Server (minimized) only takes up about **4GB** compared to **64GB** for Windows 11!

---

### 1. Prepare for Install

1. [Download Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server)  
   <!-- ![Ubuntu Server](https://res.cloudinary.com/de8dxxflb/image/upload/w_750,h_400,c_fill,q_auto,f_auto/v1745342865/server_os_mgowiv.png) -->

2. [Create a bootable USB stick with Rufus on Windows](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview)  
   *Linked in this guide are similar tutorials for macOS and Ubuntu.*

---

### 2. BIOS Setup

1. Attach a monitor, Ethernet cable, and keyboard to your mini PC.
2. Plug in the USB drive containing the Ubuntu Server installer.
3. Power on the device and repeatedly press `F2` (or your PC‚Äôs designated BIOS key) to access the BIOS setup.
4. Set the USB drive as the first boot device.
5. Save changes and exit the BIOS. The system should reboot and begin loading the Ubuntu installer from the USB drive.

---

### 3. Ubuntu Server Install Steps

1. **Language Selection**: Choose your preferred language.

3. **Choose type of install**: Select Ubuntu Server (minimized).

4. **Network Connection**: Confirm that Ethernet is connected. You should see an IP address assigned.

5. **Proxy Configuration**: Leave the proxy settings as default and select **Done**.

6. **Ubuntu Archive Mirror**: Leave this as default and select **Done**.

7. **Storage Configuration**:
  - **(Recommended) Default LVM Setup**  
    This will create a Logical Volume Manager (LVM) group and typically allocate only **~100GB** of space for Ubuntu, even if your disk is larger.  
    üìù *We will expand this volume after installation using LVM commands.*

    - **(Advanced) Use Full Disk Now**  
        1. Choose **Custom Storage Layout**
        2. **Uncheck** the option **"Set up this disk as an LVM group"**
        3. Manually create a single partition that uses the full disk (e.g., a root `/` partition and optionally `/boot` and `/efi`)
        4. Continue with the install. *This setup gives you full control from the start without needing to expand volumes later.*

8. **Storage Review**: Review the configuration and select **Continue**.

9. **Profile Setup**  
   Enter:
   - A name (e.g. `jelly`)
   - A hostname (e.g. `jellyfinsvr`)  
   - A username and password (you‚Äôll need these later)

10. **SSH Setup**: Check the box for **Install OpenSSH server** to enable remote access.

11. **Featured Server Snaps**: Select any other services you may want otherwise skip this.

12. **Finish Installation**: Once the installation is done, select **"Reboot Now"** and remove the USB drive.  
If you leave the USB plugged in, the device will try to start the installer again because we set it to boot from USB first.

13. **Login**: Log in using the username and password you just created.


14. Let's make sure the our packages are up-to-date
   ```bash
   sudo apt update # Check what updates are available
   sudo apt upgrade # Install the updates
   ```

#### üìù Expand LVM to Use Full Disk

Let's check how much space is allocated to the partition where we'll be storing our media on the Ubuntu Server.

1. Check available disk partitions with using the `lsblk` command

    ```bash
    # Example output
    NAME                      MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
    loop0                       7:0    0  73.9M  1 loop /snap/core22/1908
    loop1                       7:1    0 144.5M  1 loop /snap/docker/3064
    loop2                       7:2    0  44.4M  1 loop /snap/snapd/23771
    nvme0n1                   259:0    0 476.9G  0 disk
    ‚îú‚îÄnvme0n1p1               259:1    0     1G  0 part /boot/efi
    ‚îú‚îÄnvme0n1p2               259:2    0     2G  0 part /boot
    ‚îî‚îÄnvme0n1p3               259:3    0 473.9G  0 part
      ‚îî‚îÄubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv 252:0    0   100G  0 lvm  /
    ```

    - In this case
      - **100GB** is allocated to Ubuntu
      - **373.9GB*** is unallocated within the LVM

    - Another was to see this is is with  `sudo vgdisplay`
      - Look for a line like `Free  PE / Size       95328 / 372.0 GiB`

2. Now we want to extend the logical volume

    ```bash
    sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
    ```

3. Resize the filesystem

    ```bash
    sudo resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
    ```

4. Confirm new disk size with `df -h`

*You should now see the full disk capacity available under your root (/) partition.*

## ü™º Jellyfin

### 1. Install Jellyfin on Ubuntu Server

```shell
# One‚Äëliner install script
curl -s https://repo.jellyfin.org/install-debuntu.sh | sudo bash
```

Press Enter when prompted.

When the script finishes you should see something like:
```shell
You can access your new instance now at http://192.168.0.xx:8096 in your web browser to finish setting up Jellyfin
```

### 2. Create media folders

Now let's create a folder to put our media in
```shell
# Master media directory
sudo mkdir -p /Media

# Inside it, add the two standard libraries
sudo mkdir -p /Media/Movies
sudo mkdir -p /Media/Shows
```

‚û°Ô∏è¬†Need different names or extra folders? Check Jellyfin‚Äôs [media‚Äënaming guide](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/server/media/movies/)

### 3. Configure shared access

Replace `<username>` with your own, e.g. john.

1. Create a shared group that both you and the Jellyfin service account will join

    ```shell
    sudo groupadd mediaaccess
    ```

2. Add users to that group

    ```shell
    sudo usermod -aG mediaaccess <username>
    sudo usermod -aG mediaaccess jellyfin
    ```

3. Make the group own the media directory

    ```shell
    sudo chown -R <username>:mediaaccess /Media
    ```

4. Set permissions: readable, writeable, and executable

    ```shell
    sudo chmod -R 775 /Media
    # Ensure new files inherit the same group
    sudo chmod g+s /Media
    ```

    - 775 Permission mode:
      - 7 (owner) ‚Üí read, write, execute
      - 7 (group) ‚Üí read, write, execute
      - 5 (others) ‚Üí read, execute (no write)

5. Verify: All three lines should reference mediaaccess

    ```shell
    ls -ld /Media
    groups <username>
    groups jellyfin
    ```

### 4. Enable Jellyfin to start on boot

```bash
sudo systemctl enable jellyfin
```

- Check to make sure this worked and Jellyfin is set to startup on boot

```bash
systemctl is-enabled jellyfin
```


### 5. Finish setup in the web UI

1. Open a browser to `http://<server‚ÄëIP>:8096` (example¬†http://192.168.0.xx:8096).
2. Follow the on‚Äëscreen wizard. When it asks for Libraries, add:

    | Library name | Folder path   |
    |--------------|---------------|
    | Movies       | /Media/Movies |
    | Shows        | /Media/Shows  |

3. Complete the remaining prompts and click Finish.

## üöõ Move Mini PC to it‚Äôs Resting Place

Shut down the mini PC

```shell
sudo shutdown now
```

I did all this setup at my desk next to my main PC. Now we can unplug the keyboard, monitor and ethernet cable from the mini pc and move it to it's final location.

I placed my server next to my router and turned it on. We previously configured jellyfin to start on boot so we should be good to go.


## üéûÔ∏è Adding Media

Now that Jellyfin is up and running with access to our media folders, the next step is to add media files.

### 1. Test Connection

Before transferring anything, it's a good idea to test remote access by SSH-ing into your server from your main computer. This ensures you can manage the server without needing a direct monitor or keyboard connection.

```bash
ssh <username>@<ip_address>
```

You can also check if Jellyfin is running
```bash
systemctl status jellyfin
```

### 2. File transfer with WinSCP

1. [Download WinSCP](https://winscp.net)
- Install and launch the application.

2. Gather Ubuntu server connection info
- IP address of the Ubuntu server
- Username
- Password

3. Configure a New Site in WinSCP
    1. Open WinSCP
    2. Click New Site
    3. Set the following
      - File protocol: SFTP
      - Host name: Your server‚Äôs IP address
      - Port number: 22
      - User name: Your Ubuntu username
      - Password

4. Login
- Click Save to reuse the config later (optional)
- Click Login
- If you connect successfully, the window splits:
  - Left = Your PC
  - Right = Your Ubuntu server

Now just drag and drop files between your PC and Ubuntu Server!

## üì¶ Closing Thoughts

Setting up a Jellyfin server on a mini PC is a rewarding project that can save you money and give you more control over your media.

If you want to **access your Jellyfin server remotely**, you might consider using [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com), a simple and secure mesh VPN that can help you access your home network devices from anywhere.  
üëâ *Note: I haven‚Äôt set this up myself yet, but it‚Äôs a popular option in the Jellyfin community.*

Also, there‚Äôs a **Jellyfin app** available for many platforms
- üì± **Android**
- üçé **iOS**
- üì∫ **webOS** (Smart TVs)
