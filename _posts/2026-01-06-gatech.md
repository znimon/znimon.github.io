## 💡 Why Did I Start?

My academic background is in chemical engineering, but my career shifted toward fintech and eventually software services. Over time, I reached a point in my personal CS learning journey where I felt like I would benefit from a stronger foundation in core computer science concepts. Pursuing a master’s degree was a way to grow into a more well-rounded engineer and deepen my theoretical understanding of areas like algorithms, machine learning, and systems. On a personal level, earning degrees in two engineering disciplines mattered to me; it reflects an ability to switch domains, adapt quickly, and continue learning at a high level over the long term.

## 🏛️ Why Georgia Tech?

I believe strongly in affordable, accessible education, especially at scale. Making high-quality technical education available is one of the most effective ways to create long-term societal impact. Georgia Tech stood out not just for its cost, but for its deep and well-established history in computer science. The Georgia Tech CS program consistently ranks among the top public CS programs in the country and has a long track record of producing strong engineers and researchers. OMSCS, in particular, is designed as an online-first program rather than a diluted remote offering. It maintains academic rigor while making the degree accessible at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs. Combined with a large, active student community and the flexibility to complete the degree while working full-time, OMSCS offered a rare balance of reputation, rigor, affordability, and practicality.

## 💰Cost

The primary cost of the program was time rather than money. Completing OMSCS meant giving up nights and weekends over multiple years, along with managing a sustained cognitive load while working full-time. From a financial perspective, the tuition was covered by my employer, and I was able to complete the degree without taking on debt. I view the return on investment as long-term rather than immediate: the foundational knowledge compounds over time, increased my confidence in theoretical areas where I previously had no academic background, and serves as a signal of sustained discipline and rigor. This was a deliberate investment in long-term growth.

## 🧠 Deciding Which Classes to Take

I evaluated courses using three primary criteria: **student feedback, relevance, and personal interest**. Student feedback helped me gauge the overall quality of a class. Relevance mattered in terms of whether a course focused on foundational concepts versus more niche material, and how transferable the skills were to real-world engineering work. Personal interest also played an important role, helping me build the skills I want to develop over the long run.

## 💭 Closing

Finishing the program feels relieving, and quietly satisfying, like closing a long and demanding chapter. I’m proud of sustaining consistent effort over multiple years and completing the degree while working full-time throughout. I’m looking forward to having unstructured time back and finding more balance: spending time with friends and family, enjoying my hobbies, and learning or building things I choose. Overall, this was a rigorous CS master’s degree that rewards sustained effort and commitment.
